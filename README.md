Following steps will help you to pull project and use it locally.

### 4 - Create a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google OAuth API (optional)
I have pushed my own projects GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in .example.env file.

Remove the .example part of file name, keep it as .env. To use my project credentials keep content as it is, otherwise use your own.
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="221793251341-8n9npb6q50nmbisr3k63amdc510a6tkn.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="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"

### 5 - Create database then run migrations:
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
